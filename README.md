# Autonomous Robotic Car
[Project Page](https://jcchincheong-bb.github.io/projects/autonomous-robotic-car/index/)

I want to build a simple robotic car that detect obstacles and follow a given path or coordinates. 

## ðŸ”§ Current Features
- Motors controlled by LP298 Motor Driver
- Emergency stop triggered by ultrasonic sensor
- ROS 2 access point ready for programming

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
- Arduino 
- Robotic Car 4WD Chassis Kit with Motors
- LP298 Motor Drivers
- Ultrasonic sensor (comptabile with Arduino)
- Sufficient Power (5V for Arduino and 5-12V for the Motors)
- Breadboard


## ðŸš§ Future Work
- Wireless connection to computer via Arduino R4 Uno Wifi capabilities
- 3D printed Chassis design to fit and support all components
- Using ROS 2 to enable communication between robotic components
